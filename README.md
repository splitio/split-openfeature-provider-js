## Overview
This Provider is designed to allow the use of OpenFeature with Split, the platform for controlled rollouts, serving features to your users via the Split feature flag to manage your complete customer experience.

## Compatibility


## Getting started
Below is a simple example that describes the instantiation of the Split Provider. Please see the [OpenFeature Documentation](https://docs.openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/evaluation-api) for details on how to use the OpenFeature SDK.

### Add the Split provider

```sh
npm install @splitsoftware/openfeature-js-split-provider
```

### Confirm peer dependencies are installed
```sh
npm install @splitsoftware/splitio
npm install @openfeature/js-sdk
```

### Register the Split provider with OpenFeature
```js
const OpenFeature = require('@openfeature/js-sdk').OpenFeature;
const SplitFactory = require('@splitsoftware/splitio').SplitFactory;
const OpenFeatureSplitProvider = require('@splitsoftware/openfeature-js-split-provider').OpenFeatureSplitProvider;

const authorizationKey = 'your auth key'
const splitClient = SplitFactory({core: {authorizationKey}}).client();
const provider = new OpenFeatureSplitProvider({splitClient});
openFeature.setProvider(provider);
```

## Use of OpenFeature with Split
After the initial setup you can use OpenFeature according to their [documentation](https://docs.openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/evaluation-api/).

One important note is that the Split Provider **requires a targeting key** to be set. Often times this should be set when evaluating the value of a flag by [setting an EvaluationContext](https://docs.openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/evaluation-context) which contains the targeting key. An example flag evaluation is
```js
const client = openFeature.getClient('CLIENT_NAME');

const context: EvaluationContext = {
  targetingKey: 'TARGETING_KEY',
};
const boolValue = await client.getBooleanValue('boolFlag', false, context);
```
If the same targeting key is used repeatedly, the evaluation context may be set at the client level 
```js
const context: EvaluationContext = {
  targetingKey: 'TARGETING_KEY',
};
client.setEvaluationContext(context)
```
or at the OpenFeatureAPI level 
```js
const context: EvaluationContext = {
  targetingKey: 'TARGETING_KEY',
};
OpenFeatureAPI.getInstance().setCtx(context)
````
If the context was set at the client or api level, it is not required to provide it during flag evaluation.
